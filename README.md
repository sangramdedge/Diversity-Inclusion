# Diversity-Inclusion
This Diversity &amp; Inclusion dashboard highlights KPIs on hiring, promotions, turnover, performance ratings, gender balance, and age distribution. It enables tracking gender equity, workforce trends, and inclusion efforts. Dynamic filters for department, job level, and age group provide actionable insights for fostering a more inclusive workplace.

The goal of this Diversity & Inclusion dashboard is to promote gender equity and inclusivity by offering a thorough overview of workforce trends and data. There are six key performance indicators (KPIs) that make up the dashboard:

-Hiring (KPI 1): The gender distribution of hires across job levels is shown in this section. It highlights the percentage of women recruited in each category by comparing the hiring rates for men and women. A bar chart displays the absolute numbers for both sexes, while a line chart overlays the data to display trends in the percentage of women hired. Quick insights, including the general percentages of male and female hiring, are provided by summary cards.

-Promotions (KPI 2): This KPI shows the proportion of female promoted employees and tracks promotions by gender. The average amount of time workers spend in their current position prior to promotion is also displayed in the chart. Potential gaps in gender-based promotional possibilities can be found with the aid of insights regarding career progression trends across job levels.

-Turnover Rate (KPI 3): In this section, average performance evaluations of departing employees and non-leavers by job level and gender are compared to analyse turnover rates. By showing which groups are more likely to depart and their performance ratings, it provides insights into retention trends. Strategies for increasing staff retention can be guided by this information.

-Performance Rating (KPI 4): Averages for men and women are displayed along with gender-specific performance ratings. Analysis of gender-based performance perceptions or prejudices is made possible by a thorough breakdown that displays the percentage distribution of scores across four categories.

-Executive Gender Balance (KPI 5):
This section focuses on leadership roles, comparing gender splits in executive positions for consecutive years. It also includes data on executive hires and promotions, emphasizing progress in achieving gender equity in top-level roles.

-Executive Gender Balance (KPI 5): This section compares the gender distribution in executive jobs over a period of years, with an emphasis on leadership responsibilities. Data on executive promotions and hires is also included, highlighting advancements made towards gender parity in high-level positions.

-Age Group Distribution (KPI 6): This KPI illustrates the age distribution of workers across age groups and job levels. It highlights generational representation within the company and offers insights on workforce diversity beyond gender.

-Genral Insights:
Departmental & Regional Variances: Gender inequalities are more pronounced in some departments or regions, which suggests that specific interventions are needed in those areas.
Prospects for Inclusivity: Overall inclusiveness can be enhanced by putting in place mentorship programs, flexible work schedules, and focused recruitment and advancement initiatives.
